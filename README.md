# Flutter template using GetX package

I use this repo as a template for my personal Flutter projects. It is using a modular MVC architecture. Still improving. 🫡

## Packages

This template only uses one core package, [get](https://pub.dev/packages/get), which enables :
- State management
- Dependency injection
- Routing
- HTTP client

But also other things that are not implemented here :
- Snackbars / dialogs / bottomsheets
- Shared preferences
- Internationalization
- Theme changing
- Validators

It has the benefit to have a single lightweight solution for all these usages instead of having to add several packages. For example one for the state management, another for the HTTP client, another for the router, etc... 

## Architecture overview

```yaml
- /lib
  # Global components
  - /components
  # Contains everything related to local and remote data
  - /core
    # Error handling

      - colors.dart
      # Custom themes (light and dark)
      - themes.dart
    # I added my const values in utils but you can also add yours extensions and helper functions / classes
    - /utils
      # Your enums if they exist
      - enums.dart
      # Padding constants used on screens
      - paddings.dart
      # String constants used on screens

    - /models
      - example_model.dart
    # API's, local database, shared preferences, Firebase, etc...

      # Deals with states and user inputs
      - example_controller.dart
      # Presentation layer
