# Flutter template using GetX package

I use this repo as a template for my personal Flutter projects. It is using a modular MVC architecture. Still improving. ðŸ«¡

## Packages
### GetX

This template uses a core package, [get](https://pub.dev/packages/get), which enables :
- State management
- Dependency injection
- Routing
- HTTP client

But also other things that are not implemented here :
- Snackbars / dialogs / bottomsheets
- Shared preferences
- Internationalization
- Theme changing
- Validators

It has the benefit to have a single lightweight solution for all these usages instead of having to add several packages. For example one for the state management, another for the HTTP client, another for the router, etc... 

### Dartz

[dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) enables better error handling, especially with API calls.
